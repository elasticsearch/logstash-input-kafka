## Kafka Input Plugin's Issue Tracker Has Moved

The Kafka Input Plugin is now a part of the [Kafka Integration Plugin][integration-source]. 
This project remains open for backports of fixes from that project to the 9.x series where possible, but issues should first be filed on the [integration plugin][integration-issues].

Please post all product and debugging questions on our [forum][logstash-forum].
Your questions will reach our wider community members there. If we confirm that there is a bug, then we can open a new issue on the appropriate project.
