# This input will read events from a Kafka topic. It uses the high level consumer API provided
# by Kafka to read messages from the broker. It also maintains the state of what has been
# consumed using Zookeeper. The default input codec is json
#
# You must configure `topic_id`, `white_list` or `black_list`. By default it will connect to a
# Zookeeper running on localhost. All the broker information is read from Zookeeper state
#
# Ideally you should have as many threads as the number of partitions for a perfect balance --
# more threads than partitions means that some threads will be idle

  #
  # The server may also have a ZooKeeper chroot path as part of it's ZooKeeper connection string
  # which puts its data under some path in the global ZooKeeper namespace. If so the consumer
  # should use the same chroot path in its connection string. For example to give a chroot path of
